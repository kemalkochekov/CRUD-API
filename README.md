## Linting and Code Quality

This project maintains code quality using `golangci-lint`, a fast and customizable Go linter. `golangci-lint` checks for various issues, ensures code consistency, and enforces best practices, helping maintain a clean and standardized codebase.

### Linting Installation

To install `golangci-lint`, you can use `brew`:

```bash
  brew install golangci-lint
```

### Linting Usage
1. Configuration: 

After installing golangci-lint, create or use a personal configuration file (e.g., .golangci.yml) to define specific linting rules and settings:
```bash
  golangci-lint run --config=.golangci.yml
```
This command initializes linting based on the specified configuration file.

2. Run the linter:

Once configuration is completed, you can execute the following command at the root directory of your project to run golangci-lint:

```bash
  golangci-lint run
```
This command performs linting checks on your entire project and provides a detailed report highlighting any issues or violations found.

3. Customize Linting Rules:

You can customize the linting rules by modifying the `.golangci.yml` file.

For more information on using golangci-lint, refer to the golangci-lint documentation.
